ggson is declarative way for producing plots using ggplot for SAR output.

ggplot2 give elegant plots, typical performance assignment needs to be able to plot SAR output.
ggplot2 is simple to use library, however, using it repeatedly becomes boring. With ggson you
specify the how to search a perticular file variable inside it and the type of plots you want:
box, jitter, jitter+box, scatter. 

For example, you have sar data for two tests and extracted in CSV format.
    alltest/
        test1/
            |
            sar.cpu
        test2/
            |
            sar.cpu


Create a JSON
    {
        "CPU_compare" {
            "pattern" : "*.cpu$",
            "category" : "CPU",
            "graph_set1" : {
                "group" : [ "%idle", "%user", "%system"],
                "graph" : ["boxplt", "timeseries" ]
            }
    }

You can provide this JSON to ggson and it will provide you a boxplot and scatter plot.
There are many other options you can add to JSON check out all.json file to get a feel.
